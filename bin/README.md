# bin

## UNIX Says:  
	
How UNIX defines the purpose of /bin directory:

/bin is a standard subdirectory of the root directory in Unix-like operating systems that contains the executable (i.e., ready to run) programs that must be available in order to attain minimal functionality for the purposes of booting (i.e., starting) and repairing a system.

## Why bin in this repo ?

In this directory we will keep all the executables that we have written on our own. We can think of this as a collection of generic scripts related to ssh, installation, environment troubleshooting etc. This can be domain agnostic i.e. not Nykaa Specific thing.s
